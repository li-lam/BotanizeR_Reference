# Overview

This tutorial illustrates how to use the BotanizeR Shiny application. It is
based on the following 
[instance](https://gift.uni-goettingen.de/shiny/BotanizeR/). 

When you load this webpage, you first arrive on the Quiz tab.

\newpage

# Quiz tab

Here you can practice your species identification skills in a playful way.
Pictures of a random species will appear on the screen. If several pictures are
available, you can switch pictures by clicking the left and right arrows on the
picture's side. 
<br>
On the left, several checkboxes are made available. When clicking them,
dedicated clues appear on the right side. On Figure 1, information about the
ecology and the clonality of the species are displayed. Sources of the pictures
are also available below these hints and the picture, and you can click them to
get redirected to the relevant websites.
<br>
To enter your answer, you need to write in the bar called 'Species name'. As
indicated below, to submit your answer you need to hit 'Enter' on your keyboard
or to click the 'Submit' button on the bottom. The app then tells you whether
your attempt was correct or by how many characters your answer is differing
from the truth. The app also recognizes whether you have guessed the right
genus of the species. If you cannot find what species it is, you can always
hit the arrow down on your keyboard or click the 'Answer' button to reveal the
species's name. Finding the answer, on your own or with the solution,
automatically shows you all the possible hints.To change species, you can click
the 'New plant' button or hit the arrow up on your keyboard. A new species will
then appear.

```{r, fig.label = "Figure 1. Quiz tab", out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/BotanizeR_printscreen1.png")
```

<br>

The quiz keeps track of the species shown and and of your score. This is useful
in two ways: first, the probability to pick a certain species will depend on
your score. The app will pick up more often species which you struggle to
identify and will tend to omit the ones you know. This feature can be disabled
in the Setup tab. Second, you can highlight you score and see in a graphical
way how much you performed. You can even share your score by using the Twitter
button (Fig. 2).

```{r, fig.label = "Figure 2. Quiz statistics", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/BotanizeR_printscreen2.png")
```

## Uploading/downloading a table

Finally, you have the opportunity to download the species list after
practicing. This option is available by clicking the button
'Upload/Download progress' (Figure 3).
<br>

```{r, fig.label = "Figure 3. Uploading/downloading progress", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/BotanizeR_printscreen_updownload.png")
```

<br>
If you want to keep track of your past progress, you can then upload your list
again. The number of successes and failures can then affect the probability to
pick a certain species from the species list.
<br>
The functionality 'Upload' can also be used to run the quiz on a specific list
of interest. For example, if you want to practice only the orchid species from
Germany, you can upload a table with only this subset of species.
<br>
<br>
**Please note that these tables need to formatted in a specific way.**
<br>
Indeed, several columns need to be incorporated in the table. If they are not
present, the Shiny app will not be able to use your data. The best way to have
a table with the columns needed is first to directly download the species list
already available within the Shiny app. In a second step, you can remove/add
certain rows to update the species list. Finally, you can update your table.
<br>
While the existing columns should be kept, you also have the possibility to
add extra columns that will give you supplementary hints. In the Setup tab,
you can for example see that four extra hints are available (English_name of
the species, French name, Description and Distribution).
<br>
**If you want to add an hint, create a column with the name 'ownhint_YourHint'**

\newpage

# Setup tab

In the Setup tab you can modify a few options to customize your quiz. Here is
what you can do:

```{r, fig.label = "Figure 4. Uploading/downloading progress", out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/BotanizeR_printscreen3.png")
```

<br>

*Select a species list*
Here you can choose from which list you want to practise. You can either choose
from a predefined list or upload your own list, as described above in the Quiz
tab section. Upload lists will be available in the dropdown menu as soon as you
upload them into the app.
<br><br>
*Upload a list* <br>
Same principle than in the Quiz tab. You can upload your own species list. The
table needs to have certain columns.
<br>

*Subset by local species* <br>
You can here subset the species list by those species found in GBIF for a
defined radius around a desired location. By default 10000 species are
retrieved since this option is based on the code of `BotanizeR_getlocallist()`.
*Note that this function can take a while.* If it is too long, consider
reducing the radius.
<br><br>
*Download the species list* <br>
As described in the Quiz tab, you can download the species table after
practicing it with the quiz if you want ot keep track of your score.
<br><br>
*Custom material* <br>
Here you define which supplementary hints and images to make available in the
Species and Quiz tabs. The hints are added to the species table in new columns.
Column names should be named **ownhint_YourHint**. You can also add personal
images to display the species. These images can either be retrieved from a
local folder on your computer (**Image folders**) or be added manually in the
species table in dedicated columns named **imagelink_X**, X being a number.
In these columns, you can add URL links to certain images.
<br>
For example, in Figure 5, we illustrate how to add an own hint for a species
(its English name), and a own link for another image (Wikipedia link).
<br>
```{r, fig.label = "Figure 5. Own hint and image", out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/BotanizeR_printscreen_speciestable.png")
```
<br><br>
*Quiz controls* <br>
Here you define whether the probabilies to sample species should be based on
your previous score or not. It is by default activated.
<br><br>
*Online resources* <br>
Here you tick or untick the available checkboxes that correspond to the two
available online resources that come with BotanizeR: Floraweb and the Online
Atlas of the British and Irish flora.

# Species tab

In the Species tab, you can retrieve all information for each species using the drop down menu. The information available is dependent upon what you
tick/untick and upload in the Setup tab.

```{r, fig.label = "Figure 6. Species tab", out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/BotanizeR_printscreen_speciestab.png")
```

Note that when the species list is long, it can be quite tedious to find the
species you search for. To avoid this, you can simply type the species name or
part of it in the drop down menu and then directly click it (Fig. 7).

```{r, fig.label = "Figure 7. Species list menu", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/BotanizeR_printscreen_specieslist.png")
```
